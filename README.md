# COVID-19 Time Series Forecasting 📊

This project performs a time series analysis of COVID-19 data using the Prophet library to visualize trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and forecast future cases based on current trends.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
	•	Visualize COVID-19 trends globally, including confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
	•	Analyze the rate of infection and recovery over time.
	•	Forecast the number of COVID-19 cases for the next week using Prophet.

📋 Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need the following Python libraries:
	•	pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
	•	plotly: For creating interactive visualizations.
	•	prophet: For time series forecasting.

You can install these libraries with the following commands:

pip install pandas plotly prophet

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains COVID-19 data with the following columns:
	•	Date: Date of the record.
	•	Confirmed: Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
	•	Deaths: Number of deaths due to COVID-19.
	•	Recovered: Number of recovered patients.

The file should be in CSV format. You can use your own dataset as long as it includes these columns.

🧑‍💻 Files
	•	covid_data.csv: Input CSV file containing historical COVID-19 data.
	•	covid_forecast.csv: Output CSV file containing predicted COVID-19 cases for the next 7 days.
	•	covid_time_series_analysis.py: Python script that performs the analysis and forecasting.

💻 How to Run the Code
	1.	Download the covid_data.csv file and place it in the same directory as the script.
	2.	Open a terminal/command prompt in the directory where the script is located.
	3.	Run the following command:

python covid_time_series_analysis.py

📈 Data Visualization

The project uses Plotly to visualize:
	•	Confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
	•	Infection and recovery rates using percentage changes.

📅 Time Series Forecasting

The script uses the Prophet library to forecast future COVID-19 cases for the next 7 days. Prophet works by modeling seasonal patterns and detecting trends in historical data, providing an estimate of future cases.

🎥 Animation & Interactivity

With Plotly, the visualizations are interactive:
	•	Zoom, hover, and pan to explore the data.
	•	Animated charts to view trends over time.

🧩 Key Components of the Forecast
	•	Trend: Overall upward or downward pattern in COVID-19 cases.
	•	Seasonality: Seasonal fluctuations such as daily, weekly, or yearly trends.
	•	Forecast: Predictions for the next 7 days based on historical data.

🌍 Interactive Global Trends

Interactive visualizations allow you to see the global spread of COVID-19, including:
	•	Confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
	•	Infection and recovery rates over time.

🛠️ Example Code

Here’s a simple example of how to use Prophet for time series forecasting:

from prophet import Prophet
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('covid_data.csv')

# Prepare data for Prophet (ds is the date column, y is the target column)
df_prophet = df[['Date', 'Confirmed']].rename(columns={'Date': 'ds', 'Confirmed': 'y'})

# Initialize and fit the Prophet model
model = Prophet(daily_seasonality=True)
model.fit(df_prophet)

# Create a future dataframe for 7 days
future = model.make_future_dataframe(df_prophet, periods=7)

# Forecast future values
forecast = model.predict(future)

# Plot the forecast
model.plot(forecast)

📅 Visualizing the Forecast

The forecasted data for the next 7 days is displayed alongside historical data, showing both the trend and uncertainty intervals.

🌱 Next Steps
	•	Try running the script with your own dataset to analyze different countries or regions.
	•	Customize the model with additional holidays or events that might influence the trends.
	•	Explore the components of the forecast to understand the seasonal patterns.

🎯 Conclusion

This project leverages Prophet for time series forecasting and Plotly for visualization, allowing users to track COVID-19 trends and make predictions for the future. It provides insights into global health trends and helps in decision-making.
